The operators `??=`, `||=`, and `&&=` were introduced in **ES2021** (though often discussed with ES2020 features) to make assignment operations more concise and easier to manage. Here's a breakdown of what each of them does:

### 1. **Nullish Assignment (`??=`)**
The `??=` operator assigns a value to a variable if that variable is `null` or `undefined`.

**Syntax**:
```javascript
x ??= y;
```

- If `x` is `null` or `undefined`, then `x` will be assigned the value `y`.
- Otherwise, `x` retains its current value.

**Example**:
```javascript
let a = null;
a ??= 5;  // a becomes 5

let b = undefined;
b ??= 10;  // b becomes 10

let c = 0;
c ??= 20;  // c remains 0 because it's not null or undefined
```

### 2. **Logical OR Assignment (`||=`)**
The `||=` operator assigns a value to a variable if the variable is a **falsy** value (i.e., `false`, `0`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, or `""`).

**Syntax**:
```javascript
x ||= y;
```

- If `x` is falsy, then `x` is assigned the value `y`.
- Otherwise, `x` retains its current value.

**Example**:
```javascript
let a = 0;
a ||= 5;  // a becomes 5 because 0 is falsy

let b = false;
b ||= true;  // b becomes true because false is falsy

let c = 'Hello';
c ||= 'World';  // c remains 'Hello' because it's truthy
```

### 3. **Logical AND Assignment (`&&=`)**
The `&&=` operator assigns a value to a variable only if the variable is **truthy**.

**Syntax**:
```javascript
x &&= y;
```

- If `x` is truthy, then `x` is assigned the value `y`.
- Otherwise, `x` retains its current value.

**Example**:
```javascript
let a = true;
a &&= false;  // a becomes false because true is truthy

let b = 10;
b &&= 20;  // b becomes 20 because 10 is truthy

let c = 0;
c &&= 30;  // c remains 0 because 0 is falsy
```

### Summary of Their Usage:
- **`??=`**: Assigns only if the current value is `null` or `undefined`.
- **`||=`**: Assigns if the current value is **falsy**.
- **`&&=`**: Assigns if the current value is **truthy**.

These operators provide more expressive ways of handling default values and conditional assignments, reducing the need for verbose `if` checks or `||` and `&&` operators in longer forms.
