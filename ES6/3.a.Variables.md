Before ES6 there was only one way of defining your variables: with the var keyword. If you did not define them, they would be assigned to the global object. Unless you were in strict mode, then you would get an error if your variables were undefined.

Now, with ES6, there are three ways of defining your variables: var, let, and const.

   
In JavaScript, `var`, `let`, and `const` are used to declare variables, but they have different characteristics and behaviors. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison:

### 1. `var`

**Scope:**
- `var` is function-scoped, meaning it is accessible within the function it is declared in.
- If declared outside of any function, it is globally scoped.

**Hoisting:**
- Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with `undefined`.

**Re-declaration and Re-assignment:**
- Variables declared with `var` can be re-declared and re-assigned.

**Example:**
```javascript
console.log(x); // undefined (due to hoisting)
var x = 5;
console.log(x); // 5

var y = 10;
var y = 20; // Allowed
y = 30;    // Allowed
```

### 2. `let`

**Scope:**
- `let` is block-scoped, meaning it is accessible only within the block (enclosed by `{}`) where it is declared.

**Hoisting:**
- Variables declared with `let` are hoisted but not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

**Re-declaration and Re-assignment:**
- Variables declared with `let` cannot be re-declared within the same scope but can be re-assigned.

**Example:**
```javascript
// console.log(a); // ReferenceError (temporal dead zone)
let a = 5;
console.log(a); // 5

let b = 10;
// let b = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'b' has already been declared
b = 30; // Allowed
```

### 3. `const`

**Scope:**
- `const` is block-scoped, similar to `let`.

**Hoisting:**
- Variables declared with `const` are hoisted but not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

**Re-declaration and Re-assignment:**
- Variables declared with `const` cannot be re-declared or re-assigned. However, if the variable is an object or array, the contents of the object or array can be modified.

**Example:**
```javascript
// console.log(c); // ReferenceError (temporal dead zone)
const c = 5;
console.log(c); // 5

// const d = 10;
// const d = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'd' has already been declared
// d = 30; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

const e = [1, 2, 3];
e.push(4); // Allowed
console.log(e); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

const f = { key: 'value' };
f.key = 'newValue'; // Allowed
console.log(f); // { key: 'newValue' }
```

### Summary

1. **Scope:**
   - `var` is function-scoped.
   - `let` and `const` are block-scoped.

2. **Hoisting:**
   - `var` is hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.
   - `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized, leading to a `ReferenceError` if accessed before declaration.

3. **Re-declaration:**
   - `var` can be re-declared within the same scope.
   - `let` and `const` cannot be re-declared within the same scope.

4. **Re-assignment:**
   - `var` and `let` can be re-assigned.
   - `const` cannot be re-assigned, but the contents of objects and arrays declared with `const` can be modified.

### Choosing Between `let` and `const`

- Use `const` by default for variables that should not be re-assigned. This makes your code more predictable and easier to understand.
- Use `let` for variables that need to be re-assigned.
